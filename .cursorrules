tests go in the tests directory ./tests

tests should be named after the file they test, with the exception of e2e tests. For example analyzer.test.ts corresponds to analyzer.ts

e2e tests go in tests/e2e and use the production db

tests that are not in the e2e directory use the test db which is in fixtures
